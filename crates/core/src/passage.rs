///
/// 1. **CoreMetadata** — StoryData (format detection) and StoryTitle.
///    These are TwineCore name-matched passages with `Metadata` behavior.
///    StoryData must be identified first because it determines which format
///    plugin is active, which in turn affects all subsequent classification.
///
/// 2. **CoreNamed** — Other Twine-core name-matched passages (Start).
///    These are always recognized by name regardless of the active format.
///    A passage named "Start" with `[widget]` is still Start, not a widget.
///
/// 3. **CoreTagged** — Twine-core tag-matched passages ([script], [stylesheet],
///    [style]). These are compiler constructs that apply across all formats.
///    Checked after core name matches so that a passage named "StoryInit"
///    tagged [script] is classified as StoryInit (CoreNamed/FormatNamed),
///    not as a script passage.
///
/// 4. **CoreLegacy** — Twine 1 legacy name-matched passages ("script" and
///    "stylesheet" as passage NAMES, not tags). Import/migration only.
///
/// 5. **FormatNamed** — Format-specific name-matched passages (StoryInit,
///    PassageHeader, StoryCaption, etc.). Singleton passages identified by
///    exact name. The specific set depends on the active format plugin.
///
/// 6. **FormatTagged** — Format-specific tag-matched passages ([init],
///    [widget] for SugarCube; [header], [footer], [startup] for
///    Harlowe). Multiple passages can share a tag.
///
/// 7. **Regular** — User-defined passages with no special definition match.
///    Tag checking happens BEFORE classifying as Regular, ensuring that
///    passages with special tags are never missed.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// The `Passage::category()` method derives the category from the passage's
/// `special_def` field. The `FormatPlugin::classify_passage_category()`
/// method performs the full priority cascade and returns both the
/// `SpecialPassageDef` (if matched) and the `PassageCategory`.
///
/// ## Downstream Impact
///
/// Handlers that need to distinguish passage types should prefer
/// `passage.category()` over raw `is_special` checks. The category
/// provides more granular information for diagnostics, graph construction,
/// and semantic token generation:
///
/// - **Diagnostics**: `CoreMetadata` and `CoreNamed` passages are always
///   exempt from broken-link, orphan, and dead-end diagnostics.
///   `CoreTagged` passages are also exempt. `FormatTagged` passages with
///   `participates_in_graph: false` should be excluded from graph analysis.
/// - **Graph**: Only passages with `participates_in_graph: true` get graph
///   nodes. The category helps determine which implicit edges to add.
/// - **Semantic tokens**: The category determines the token type
///   (SpecialPassageHeader vs PassageHeader) and layer modifier
///   (TwineCore, StoryFormat).

/// `special_passages()` lists. The server merges Twine-core definitions
/// with format-specific ones when building the complete special passage
/// registry. This ensures that:
///
/// 1. Twine-core passages are always recognized regardless of format.
/// 2. Format plugins don't duplicate or misinterpret compiler constructs.
/// 3. Diagnostics and graph edges for core passages are consistent.
///
/// ## Matching Strategy
///
/// Core passages use BOTH matching strategies per the Twee 3 spec:
///
/// - **Name-matched** (`MatchStrategy::Name`): `StoryTitle`, `StoryData`,
///   `Start`. These are singleton passages — only one passage with each
///   name can exist in a story.
///
/// - **Tag-matched** (`MatchStrategy::Tag`): `script`, `stylesheet`.
///   Multiple passages can share these tags, and the passage name can be
///   anything. Tweego compiles them in alphabetical order by passage name.
///
/// ## Script & Stylesheet Passages
///
/// In the Twee 3 specification, `script` and `stylesheet` are defined as
/// **special tags**, not special passage names. Any passage tagged
/// `[script]` contains JavaScript; any passage tagged `[stylesheet]`
/// contains CSS. The passage name is user-defined and irrelevant for
/// matching. This is the canonical mechanism in Tweego-based workflows.
///
/// In the compiled HTML, script/stylesheet passages become `<script>` and
/// `<style>` children of `<tw-storydata>`, not named passages in any
/// format's passage store. SugarCube loads them as `tw-user-script-0`
/// and `tw-user-style-0`.
