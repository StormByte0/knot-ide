//! SugarCube AST node types.
//!
//! These are the output types of the recursive descent parser. Every
//! downstream consumer (tokens, diagnostics, links, vars, registries)
//! walks the same AST — no separate regex scanning.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The AST is a **flat node list with optional nesting**. Block macros
//! (`<<if>>...<</if>>`) carry their children inline. This gives the
//! best of both worlds: simple flat iteration for tokens/diagnostics,
//! tree structure for block content extraction.
//!
//! All byte offsets are **relative to the passage body start** (i.e.,
//! byte 0 is the first character after the header line newline). The
//! caller adds `body_offset` to get document-absolute positions.
