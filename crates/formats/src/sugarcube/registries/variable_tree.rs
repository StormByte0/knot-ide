//! Variable side table for the SugarCube format plugin.
//!
//! The `VariableTree` is a maintained side table that tracks all state variables
//! (`$var`) and temporary variables (`_var`) seen across the workspace. It is
//! populated incrementally during the ordered parse pipeline:
//!
//! 1. Script passages → oxc walk → `State.variables.*` writes
//! 2. Widget passages → SugarCube parser → `<<widget>>` variable encounters
//! 3. Normal passages → SugarCube parser → `$var` and `_var` references
//!
//! ## Hierarchical tree structure
//!
//! Variables form a tree that mirrors the runtime state hierarchy. For SugarCube,
//! `$player.hp.max` is represented as:
//!
//! ```text
//! $player          (root VarArenaNode)
//!   └─ hp          (child VarArenaNode)
//!       └─ max     (child VarArenaNode)
//! ```
//!
//! Each node in the tree has its own `accesses` list. When an operation targets
//! a leaf node (e.g., `$player.hp.max = 100`), the access is recorded at the
//! **actual target node** and **propagated** up to all ancestor nodes. This means
//! a write to `$player.hp.max` also counts as a write to `$player.hp` and
//! `$player` — because modifying a property inherently modifies the parent object.
//!
//! Propagated accesses are marked with `propagated: true` on the `VarAccess`
//! record so consumers can distinguish direct vs inferred accesses when needed.
//!
//! ## Normalized keys
//!
//! All variables are stored using their **normalized key**: `$foo` for story
//! variables, `_bar` for temporary variables. Both the SugarCube shorthand
//! (`$foo`) and the JavaScript API form (`State.variables.foo`) are unified
//! to the same normalized key.
//!
//! ## Read vs Write classification
//!
//! JavaScript does not have a variable initialization concept — variables are
//! simply read or written. The registry classifies each access:
//!
//! - **Writes**: `<<set>>` macros, assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, etc.),
//!   `<<capture>>`, `<<run>>` with assignment expressions, postfix `++`/`--`,
//!   and `State.variables.x = value` in JS.
//! - **Reads**: Condition checks (`<<if>>`, `<<elseif>>`), output macros
//!   (`<<print>>`, `<<=>>`), bare `$var` in text, `State.variables.x` in
//!   read positions in JS, and any variable reference that does not modify
//!   the variable's value.
//!
//! ## Synchronization
//!
//! The tree is a plain data structure with no internal locks. Synchronization
//! is the server's responsibility: the server's `tokio::sync::RwLock<ServerStateInner>`
//! is the sole synchronization mechanism. Read access (`&self`) is available under
//! the server's read lock, and write access (`&mut self`) is available under the
//! server's write lock.

/// - `Prose` — the variable appears in bare narrative text at the top level

/// - `MacroArg { macro_name }` — the variable appears in a macro's argument

///   Also covers `<<print $x>>`, `<<capture $x>>`, `<<for _i, $x in ...>>`,
///   and inline JS expressions inside macro args (`<<set $x to $y + 1>>`
///   where `$y` is classified via oxc).
/// - `MacroBody { enclosing_macro, depth }` — the variable appears in prose
///   or markup text *inside* a macro's body. Example: `$gold` in
///   `<<link "X">>You find $gold.<</link>>` has `enclosing_macro: "link"`,
///   `depth: 1`. Nested bodies increment depth: `<<link>><<if>>$x<</if>><</link>>`
///   gives `depth: 2`.
/// - `Expression` — the variable appears inside an `<<=>>expr>>` or
///   `<<->>expr>>` expression macro. These are SugarCube's inline expression
///   forms; their args are JS expressions, classified separately from regular
///   macros.
/// - `LinkSetter` — reserved for setter-link variables (`[[X->Y][$var = 1]]`).
///   Not currently produced by `collect_var_ops_from_nodes` (Link AST nodes
///   are not processed there), but included for completeness so future
///   Link-processing code can use it.
/// - `RawScript` — the variable appears inside a `<<script>>` body (raw JS)

// Arena-allocated variable tree (new implementation)

// This section defines the arena-based tree that replaces the old

//
// ## Design
//
// All nodes live in a single `Vec<VarArenaNode>` (the "arena"). Tree
// structure is encoded via `first_child` / `next_sibling` / `parent`
// indices (u32 NodeId values). This gives:
//
// - One allocation for the entire variable registry (~160KB for 2000 nodes)
// - Cache-friendly child traversal (sibling list in contiguous memory)
// - Natural subtree operations (walk from first_child)
// - Deterministic insertion order
//
// A `path_index: HashMap<String, NodeId>` provides O(1) exact lookup
// for LSP operations (hover, go-to-def, find-all-refs).

/// Index into the arena `Vec<VarArenaNode>`.
///
/// Using `u32` instead of `usize` halves the size of `Option<NodeId>`
/// (4 bytes vs 8 on 64-bit) and supports ~4 billion nodes — far more
/// than any Twine story will ever have.
pub type NodeId = u32;

/// A sentinel value indicating no node (instead of `Option<NodeId>` for
/// compactness in the arena). Used in `parent`, `first_child`, `next_sibling`.

// to `NodeId`s for O(1) lookup. To prevent cross-passage collisions between
// temporary variables with the same name (passage A's `_x` vs passage B's
// `_x`), temporary paths are namespaced with a sentinel prefix that cannot
// appear in a real SugarCube variable path.
//
// Persistent paths keep their plain display form (`"$player"`) because:
//   1. Persistent vars are workspace-global — there is no collision to avoid.
//   2. External callers (e.g. `kind_at_path("$player.hp")`) and tests use
//      the display form directly; keeping it stable preserves the API.
//
// Temporary paths become `"\u{0}<passage>:<name>"` (NUL prefix). The NUL
// byte is forbidden in SugarCube source, so no legitimate path can
// collide with the namespaced form. Callers that resolve temp paths
// must supply the enclosing passage so the key can be reconstructed;
// without it, temp lookups return `None` (safe degradation — matches
