//! Shared types for format plugins.
//!
//! These types are used by both format plugin implementations and the LSP
//! server handlers. They define the data structures for macro catalogs,
//! variable sigils, implicit passage patterns, state variable tracking,
//! and other format-specific behavioral data that handlers need to query
//! through the FormatPlugin trait.
//!
//! ## Variable Tracking Architecture
//!
//! SugarCube variables (`$var`) are NOT traditional scoped variables — they
//! are persistent entries in `SugarCube.State.variables` that survive for the
//! entire game session. Once a variable is written (via `<<set>>`,
//! `State.variables.x =`, or a JS alias), it remains in the state collection
//! indefinitely. The `<<unset>>` macro can remove a variable, but this is rare.
//!
//! This means the traditional "uninitialized variable" / "definite assignment
//! analysis" approach is **wrong** for SugarCube. Instead, we use a
//! **state variable registry** with **graph-BFS availability computation**:
//!
//! 1. **Registry**: Collect all `$var` / `State.variables.*` references across
//!    the workspace into a `StateVariable` registry.
//! 2. **Availability**: Use the passage graph to compute which passages can
//!    reach a variable's first write. If a read occurs in a passage that is
//!    NOT reachable from any write (via graph traversal), it's flagged as
//!    a **hint** (not an error), since the variable might come from a saved
//!    game state.
//! 3. **Properties**: Dot-notation paths (`$player.name`) are tracked as
//!    first-class properties of their base state variable.
//! 4. **JS Aliasing**: `State.variables.x` and `var v = State.variables; v.x`
//!    are unified with `$x` references.

// Format Registry trait (template for all format plugins)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Trait defining the standard registry interface that any story format
/// must provide for runtime-populated data.
///
/// This trait serves as the **functional template** for implementing
/// registries across all supported formats (SugarCube, Harlowe, Snowman,
/// Chapbook). Each format implements this trait with its own sub-registries,
/// but the interface remains consistent so that LSP handlers can query
/// any format's registry through the same methods.
///
/// ## Design Principles
///
/// 1. **Format isolation**: Handlers never import format-specific types.
///    They query registries through `FormatPlugin` trait methods, which
///    delegate to the active format's `FormatRegistry` implementation.
///
/// 2. **Categorized sub-registries**: Each format organizes its runtime
///    data into categories (variables, macros, functions, templates, etc.).
///    The format decides which categories it supports — not all formats
///    need all categories.
///
/// 3. **Incremental updates**: All registries support `remove_file()` and
///    `remove_passage()` for incremental re-parse without full workspace
///    re-indexing.
///
/// ## Implementing for a New Format
///
/// When adding Harlowe, Snowman, or Chapbook support:
///
/// 1. Identify the format's runtime categories (e.g., Harlowe has datatypes,
///    macros, and variables; Snowman has `window.*` globals and passages)
/// 2. Create a sub-registry for each category with this standard interface
/// 3. Compose them into a unified `FormatNameRegistry` hub
/// 4. Implement `FormatRegistry` on the hub
/// 5. Wire up through `FormatPlugin` trait accessor methods
///
/// ## Registry Categories (SugarCube example)
///
/// | Category | SugarCube Source | Harlowe Equivalent |
/// |----------|-----------------|-------------------|
/// | Variables | `$var`, `State.variables.*` | `$var` (datamap entries) |
/// | Custom Macros | `<<widget>>`, `Macro.add()` | Custom macro definitions |
/// | Functions | JS `function` in `[script]` | N/A (no JS scripting) |
/// | Templates | `Template.add()` | N/A |
